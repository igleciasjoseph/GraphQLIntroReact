# GraphQL With React and Apollo

This app was a way to get familiar with GraphQL and Apollo. You are going to need to install all the dependencies in order for this app to work properly. I was using an Express backend with MongoDB hooked up to mLab. In the server/app.js file, you must enter your connection string that you get from mLab in order to connect to your db.

## Run `npm install` to download all required dependencies before getting started

## Run `nodemon app` to start your server which will be served on port 4000, unless changed in the app.js file
